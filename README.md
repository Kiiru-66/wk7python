# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that tracks global COVID-19 trends across time and countries using Python. This project explores cases, deaths, and vaccination data, visualizes trends, and highlights key insights using real-world datasets.


## Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time-based trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- Visualize data using line charts, bar graphs, and optionally maps
- Communicate findings in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code- (Python environment)
- pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning
- matplotlib – for plotting charts
- seaborn – for enhanced data visualizations
- plotly – for interactive and choropleth maps
- geopandas – for advanced geographic plots

# How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure the `owid-covid-data.csv` dataset is placed in the project folder.
   -( You can download it from:  
     [https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) )
3. Open the `covid_global_tracker.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all the cells to view data insights and visualizations.

# Key Insights & Reflections

- Kenya's vaccination rollout progressed steadily in late 2021.
- India experienced sharp spikes in daily new cases during 2021.
- The USA had the highest total cases and deaths among selected countries.
- There is a visible correlation between vaccination efforts and reduced new deaths.
- Working with real-world data involves handling missing and inconsistent values.
